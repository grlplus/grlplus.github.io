**Submission deadline:** Friday, 29th May 2020 (23:59 AoE)

**Author notification:** 19th June

**Workshop:** 17th or 18th July

You may submit your paper through **CMT**, by following [this link](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/GRLB2020/).

We encourage submissions related to graph representation learning and geometric deep learning. We will especially appreciate submissions that connect directly with the topics of the workshop, as well as papers that introduce interdisciplinary applications and benchmarks. 

We will welcome original research papers of no more than 4 pages, not including references or supplementary materials. We request and recommend that authors rely on the supplementary material only to include minor details (e.g., hyperparameter settings) that do not fit in the 4 pages. Submissions which also qualify for the application track should be marked accordingly in CMT.

All accepted papers will be presented as virtual posters, with three contributed works, as well as three most promising novel applications, being selected for an oral presentation.

All submissions must use the [ICML template](https://icml.cc/Conferences/2020/StyleAuthorInstructions). Submissions should be in `.pdf` format, and the review process is **double-blind**---therefore the papers should be appropriately anonymised. Previously published work (or under-review) is acceptable.
