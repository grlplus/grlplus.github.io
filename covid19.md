We encourage submission of original research relevant to mitigating the impact of COVID-19. Examples of impactful use cases include: 

- drug design
- drug repurposing
- GNN-powered epidemiological forecasting models
- GNNs for track and trace
- GNN-based supply chain demand forecasting 

All submissions will be considered for a virtual poster presentation at the workshop and up to three will be selected for a COVID-19-specific contributed talk. 

[Mission AI cures](https://www.aicures.mit.edu/) provides a suite of machine learning tasks with corresponding datasets to which everyone can contribute. We welcome submissions that showcase methodology and results on these tasks. 

Below you can find a set of useful resources for relevant task specifications and datasets for COVID-19 mitigation.
